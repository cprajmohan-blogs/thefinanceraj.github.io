        <h1>Basics of Financial Planning</h1>
        
        <div class="intro">
            Financial planning can be confusing and overwhelming, with multiple sources of unrelated information. A rational approach to financial planning is to ask simple questions. This guide aims at encouraging and empowering people to ask the right questions and then providing the necessary framework to figure out the answers themselves.
        </div>

        <h2>What is the purpose of financial planning?</h2>
        <p>The purpose of financial planning is to ensure financial wellbeing of individuals and families at all times, good and bad.</p>

        <h3>What are the tools that ensure financial wellbeing?</h3>
        <p>Broadly speaking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Insurance â€” Health insurance, Term Insurance, automobile and other types of insurance</li>
            <li>Emergency funds covering from six months to one year worth of expenses</li>
            <li>Investment</li>
            <li>Estate planning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Insurance</h2>

        <h3>Does insurance provide an absolute 100% cover?</h3>
        <p>Insurance does not offer absolute cover. Sometimes insurance providers do not reimburse claims. Sometimes only a fraction of the expenses incurred is reimbursed by the insurance provider. These are due to terms and conditions of the insurance policies, some insurance providers deliberately deny or delay claims.</p>
        
        <p>Insurance is a necessary evil in the current scenario. Individuals should perform their own research before buying an insurance.</p>

        <h3>How does health insurance help? What should I know about health insurance?</h3>
        <p>A health insurance takes care of unforeseen hospitalisation expenses of an individual or family. In order to do this the insurance companies, charge a yearly payment known as premium.</p>
        
        <p>It is essential to buy a health insurance even if your employer provides you a health insurance already. This ensures that the insurance is still available even if you lose your job. In addition to these long-term illnesses prevent people from working. Hence if an individual has a long-term illness that prevents them from working, they are likely to lose the insurance provided by the employer.</p>
        
        <p>Ensure that you and your family are sufficiently covered. Do not be penny wise and pound foolish in this aspect.</p>

        <h3>What is a term insurance?</h3>
        <p>A term insurance pays the dependents of an individual, a pre-defined sum in the event of the demise of an individual. In order to do this the insurance companies, charge a yearly payment known as premium.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> If an individual named 'X' buys a term insurance by paying yearly premium of INR 20,000 and he/she passes away due to natural or unnatural causes, then his family members (dependents) get a predetermined sum say 2 crores.
        </div>
        
        <p>Always buy your own term insurance even if your employer provides one.</p>
        
        <p>Ensure that the term insurance is purchased under <strong>Married Women's Property Act 1874 (MWP Act)</strong>. This ensures that the proceeds of the insurance belong exclusively to the wife and children of the individual buying the insurance. Also ensures that the proceeds of the insurance do not go to any loans or other financial commitments, liabilities the insured might have. Banks or individuals that have lent the insured cannot claim the proceeds of the insurance.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Person 'X' has a life insurance amounting to a sum 2 crores and has home loan of 1 crore with a bank.
            <br><br>
            If he buys term insurance under MWP, then his wife and children get 2 crores in the event of his unfortunate demise.
            <br><br>
            If he does not buy term insurance under MWP, then the bank which lent his home loan gets 1 crore and his wife and family get 1 crore.
        </div>

        <h3>What is life insurance? What is the difference between life and term insurance?</h3>
        <p>Do not buy life insurance as a general thumb rule. Life insurance is different from term insurance. Roughly put life insurance combines the features term insurance and investment. The cost of life insurance is generally multiple times higher than buying term insurance and paying for investment management expenses separately. The covers (sum insured) under life insurance are as low as one lakh sometimes.</p>
        
        <p>Avail life insurance only if you are an expert in the field and you understand the finer details.</p>
        
        <p>There are other finer details that an individual needs to understand before buying term and health insurance.</p>
        
        <p>Automobile insurance is always necessary. One may also consider buying other types of insurance like home insurance, personal accidental cover, insurance pertaining to small and medium scale businesses based on individual or family requirements.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Funds</h2>

        <h3>Why do I need emergency funds?</h3>
        <p>Emergency funds protect an individual against job loss, unforeseen expenses and other financial emergencies. Insurance is necessary tool for financial well-being but it is not sufficient to cover all the expenses incurred. There could be delays in reimbursement of the insurance claims, there could some expenses that the insurance providers do not reimburse.</p>

        <h3>How much emergency funds should I accumulate?</h3>
        <p>There is no fixed number. Having six months to one year worth of expenses would offer decent protection.</p>

        <h3>How do I accumulate my emergency fund?</h3>
        <p>Reducing expenses is the only way to accumulate an emergency fund or achieve any other financial goal.</p>

        <h3>How do I protect my emergency fund against inflation?</h3>
        <p>Deposit emergency funds in fixed deposits. At current interest rates in India, they would provide some protection against inflation in the short term. In addition to this an individual would need to add more money to emergency funds, in order to keep up with inflation or other rising expenses.</p>
        
        <p>It is not ideal to invest emergency funds in equity, due to fluctuations in the markets.</p>

        <h3>What if I have financial emergency? Do I have to break my entire FD of my emergency funds?</h3>
        <p>Deposit the emergency funds in multiple FDs of roughly round INR 10,000 to INR 50,000 each. For example, if you have INR 1 lakh, deposit it in 4 FDs of 25,000 INR each.</p>
        
        <p>In case of emergency you might not have to withdraw all of your fixed deposits.</p>

        <h3>What if my banks default and I do not have funds for emergency?</h3>
        <p>Avail fixed deposits with multiple banks, under accounts of multiple family members. A rule of thumb does not deposit more than 4 lakhs with a single bank.</p>
        
        <p>These 4 lakhs include money both FD and savings account.</p>

        <h3>Why so? Why 4 lakhs?</h3>
        <p>Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insures only 5 lakhs per PAN number per bank. So even if you deposit 4 lakhs in a bank, the sum of amount deposited and interest earned for two years will still be less than 5 lakhs.</p>

        <h2>Investment</h2>

        <h3>How Should I Invest?</h3>
        <p>If you are salaried, invest as soon as you get your salary. Set aside allocation for investment and expenses, and invest before you spend.</p>

        <h3>What should I invest in?</h3>
        <p>I would not suggest any asset class. Equities, Gold, real estate, alternate investments are all good subject to one's expertise.</p>
        
        <p>But if you are beginner and you happen to choose a combination of equity and gold, you may invest in a broad-based index like NSE 500 and Gold BeES. I would suggest a 70% allocation in NSE 500 and 30% in Gold BeES. Gold BeES allows you to buy gold without physically holding gold.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> If you are investing 10,000 INR every month, then invest 7,000 in NSE 500 index fund and 3,000 in Gold BeES.
        </div>

        <h3>What is NSE 500 (Nifty 500)?</h3>
        <p>The <strong>NSE 500</strong>, also called the <strong>Nifty 500</strong>, is a stock market index that includes <strong>500 of the largest companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE)</strong> of India.</p>
        
        <p>It covers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>âœ… <strong>Large-cap</strong> companies (well-known, stable giants)</li>
            <li>âœ… <strong>Mid-cap</strong> companies (growing businesses)</li>
            <li>âœ… <strong>Small-cap</strong> companies (smaller, emerging firms)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Together, these 500 companies represent <strong>more than 90% of the total market value</strong> on the NSE. That means, when you invest in the Nifty 500, you're investing in a <strong>broad slice of the Indian economy</strong>.</p>

        <h3>How do I invest in NSE 500?</h3>
        <p>There are mutual funds that invest in the NSE 500 stocks, these are called index funds. An <strong>index fund</strong> is a type of mutual fund that <strong>copies the composition of a stock index</strong>. So, an NSE 500 (or Nifty 500) index fund will invest in the <strong>same 500 companies</strong> that are part of the Nifty 500 index, in the <strong>same proportion</strong>.</p>

        <h3>How does Gold BeES work?</h3>
        <p>The investment objective of Nippon India ETF Gold BeES is to provide returns that, closely correspond to the returns provided by Domestic price of Gold through physical gold.</p>
        
        <p>In case of gold BeES, the fund manager, Nippon India buys physical gold on behalf of all the investors who invested in the ETF. A custodian securely stores the physical gold in vaults. Investors simply buy and sell units of gold bees as the stock exchange without dealing with actual gold.</p>

        <h3>Do I have to invest in physical gold in addition to gold BeES?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Physical gold will come in handy during personal or nationwide emergencies. Under a hypothetical situation in which capital markets, financial system fail, physical gold and land will come handy.</p>

        <h3>How do I automate your investments?</h3>
        <p>Investments in mutual funds (Including NSE 500 Index funds) can be automated through monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP).</p>

        <h3>Idea behind SIP?</h3>
        <p>When an individual invests constant amount every month, he/she invests when the market prices are high, also when the market prices are low. As it is difficult to predict the market prices, we spread our investments over time.</p>

        <h3>Should I invest in real estate?</h3>
        <p>Depends on your specific expertise in real estate.</p>

        <h3>How do I accumulate large amounts over time to buy real estate?</h3>
        <p>SIPs in NSE 500 and/or Gold BeES could be good way to accumulate large amounts over long periods above 10-15 years.</p>

        <h3>Are investments in NSE 500 Risky?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The risk is significantly reduced when you invest over long periods of time. In other words, if you need money for short term purposes keep the money in FDs. If you want the money to grow over a long period of time and have significant risk appetite, invest in equities.</p>

        <h3>Why NSE 500?</h3>
        <p>When you invest in invest in NSE 500, you invest in top 500 companies listed in the Indian stock market. These are the largest companies in India by market cap. So, you are indirectly investing in the Indian Economy.</p>

        <h3>What are tax saving Investments?</h3>
        <p>ELSS and NPS are equity linked tax saving investments. ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme) has a lock in period of 3 years.</p>
        
        <p>NPS can be withdrawn in part only after the investor is 60 years old. After the investor becomes 60, 60% of NPS can be withdrawn. The rest 40% will be used to create a yearly pension plan known as Annuity.</p>

        <h3>How much to invest in NPS and ELSS?</h3>
        <p>Talk to your CA to understand this, it varies from person to person. Generally, bear in mind NPS, has severe withdrawal limitations.</p>

        <h3>Tax implications of health and term insurance?</h3>
        <p>There are tax benefits associated with health and term insurance premia.</p>

        <h2>Estate Planning</h2>

        <h3>What is estate planning?</h3>
        <p>Estate planning is deciding who inherits an individual's assets (financial, property, etc.), after an individual passes away. It protects your loved ones and avoids disputes.</p>

        <h3>How to write a will?</h3>
        <p>A will can be written on plain paper. Have two witnesses sign the will. However, please consult lawyer and get a proper will to avoid confusions. Ideally get your will notarized and registered.</p>

        <h3>What is Trust?</h3>
        <p>The purpose of trust is to manage and protect assets for someone else. It ensures that the right person gets the asset at the right time and can help avoid legal delays, taxes and misuse.</p>

        <h3>When to use a will and when a trust?</h3>
        <p>A will is simpler and works well for straight forward situations while a trust provides more control and protection for complex and high value assets.</p>

        <h3>Other factors in estate planning?</h3>
        <p><strong>Power of attorney:</strong> Choose someone to make decisions for you if you are unable to.</p>
        
        <p>Indicate clear beneficiaries and/or nominees for all your investments and insurance. Make regular updates to your financial plan with big life changes. Let your family know your plans to avoid confusions later.</p>

        <h3>Are there aspects and ways of estate planning?</h3>
        <p>Nomination of family members in bank accounts, DMAT, mutual funds, insurance and other accounts.</p>
        
        <p>Opening joint accounts like either or survivor / former or survivor depending on needs, holding joint DMAT, joint mutual fund accounts etc. Joint accounts have their own limitations.</p>
